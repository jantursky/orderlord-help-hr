One restaurant could contain multiple brands (see below), which are creating a cloud kitchen functionality | brand - specific menu for the company, for instance. company (named “Sumo food”) is preparing sushi -&gt; Sumo food brand | company (named “Burgerbrat”) is preparing meat food -&gt; Burgerbrat brand | company (named “Meat.ly”) is preparing Mexican food -&gt; Meat.ly brand | this 3. brands can coexist under one restaurant (principle of Dark/Cloud kitchen) | . | item - a general description of one or more meals, which are divided according to several types item category - a category that may contain any type (single or multiple) of the meal, deal, a meal with a variable price, etc.. A category may contain subcategories. The depth of this tree structure can be multiple times. | meal - food that includes price, tax, quantity change, etc. | meal with a variable price - food that differs from meal only in that it has a dynamically adjustable price depending on e.g. weight (eg ham, salami, fish, etc.). | deal - the combination of one or more meals, categories, pizzas or 1/2 pizzas in which it is not possible to change the quantity for its individual meals and the price of the resulting deal is calculated according to the set pricing strategy | pizza - we can also call it “Make Your Own Pizza”. The customer has the possibility to create the pizza in three steps, most often it is “Type of dough” (garlic, cheese), “Basis for pizza” (ketchup, cream) and specific “Type of pizza” (like Hawai, vegan). Subsequently, he can add additions or remove ingredients. | pizza deal or 1/2 pizza - a type of item similar to pizza, but it is possible to make a half pizza of one type (like Hawai) and half pizza of another type (like Salami), where the final price of the pizza deal is calculated based on the pricing strategy setup on the pizza deal | addition - topping that can be additionally added to an item of a certain type (food, food with variable price, pizza, 1/2 pizza) | ingredient - topping that is already on the food and can be removed after the customer’s request. Depending on the type of food, the final price of the food decreases or remains the same (the price is calculated according to the pricing strategy) | . | driver, courier - a person delivering an order with a prepared meal to a customer | cooked state for food - once when the food is cooked and ready for the packaging/final preparation process | prepared state for food - the moment when the food is packaged and ready for handover to the customer at the point of delivery or at the store | tag - a user in our system can create tags, these tags can be set up on one or more items. It is also possible to set these tags to the category to which these items are assigned, then all items in this category will inherit these tags from the category. These tags are useful in the kitchen application logic, where the chef can filter certain foods through these tags. For example, a tag called Hamburgers has been created that has been set to the category in which each burger is offered, or to each burger separately. Consequently, if this tag is set to filter, only the orders and individual meals to which this tag belongs will be displayed. | partner system ID - a unique text identifier created in our system that is transferable to external integration | public system ID - a unique external text identifier that was created in an external integration | creator of the order - the system in which the order was created. E.g. in the case of “System” as the creator, it means that the order was created in the Orderlord Android cashier system or via a web dashboard. Else the creator is an external integration. | receipt - printed paper that is handed over to the customer and contains information about the restaurant, the customer, individual items, the total price of the order with additional pricing information, a list of taxes applied to each item, etc. | kitchen receipt - printed paper, which, unlike a traditional receipt, contains only simplified order information and a list of individual meals. This block is mostly used for kitchen purposes if the cook needs to see the order information in printed form, respectively. for the purpose of reviewing the content of the order | label - a special type of paper that is attached to individual packs of food. These labels contain information about the items from the order, with each item being printed separately on one label. | finish order/collect order - if the order was handed over to the customer by courier, at the store, or the customer has completed the order for a restaurant order, the order is finished (collected) | cancel the order - if the order could not be delivered to the customer (eg, the customer was not enough, canceled by the customer, test order, etc.), the order can be canceled. | account settings - each account in the system has settings associated with it. These settings customize each option, allow functionality in applications as well as use applications themselves, enable integrations, etc. | menu - a menu associated with a restaurant that may contain items of different types. | time slot - during order creation it is possible to assign orders to so-called “time slots”. These slots can have a fixed start time when the section begins, the end time of cooking in the kitchen, and the subsequent end time of delivery of the order or handover of the order to the customer in the restaurant. It is also possible to set the maximum number of orders that can be assigned to given slots. | item description - additional information for the item, mostly describing raw materials or the recipe of the meal | item cook time - information preparation time, which is used for the auto-preparation logic for the items | default delivery time - the interval of delivery orders, from which the orders will be visible | default collection time - the interval of collection orders, from which the orders will be visible | default store time - the interval of store orders, from which the orders will be visible | order deadline buffer - is the extra time for the cook that is added for every order of the type motorcycle delivery (collection and store orders has 0 mins.) | .",
