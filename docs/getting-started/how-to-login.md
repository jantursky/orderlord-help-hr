## Basic login
- Open the application **"Orderlord HR"**. The new screen will be displayed. You could notice, that for the first time, you need to enable some permissions or allow access for some features for proper working of the application.

- Type on the first input line **Email** assigned email for the user. The format of the login name should be an email address, like **orderlord.test@gmail.com** (just as an example). Be aware to not add spaces on the start or end of the input. Type the password for the user. Once you click on the {% include icon.html name="visibility_off" %} eye icon on the right, the password will be displayed (for control purposes). Then click on the <span class="text-orange-200">**SIGN IN**</span> button.

- The application will try to check that credentials are valid and sign in. The user is then moved to the [**main application page**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/getting-started/how-to-use-the-hr-application.md %}).
