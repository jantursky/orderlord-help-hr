## How to use the HR application
- once the user will log into the HR application, the latest status of clocked-in users will be downloaded. Once the user needs to change clock-in/out status, there are two ways how to do that:
1. If the user needs to be **clock-in**, then he needs to click on the <span class="text-blue-100">blue circle button</span> on the bottom right of the screen. The popup with the list of all available users will be displayed. Only users, which have assigned PIN verification option (<span class="text-red-200">"pin not set"</span> phrase), can continue in clock-in process.
1. If the user needs to be **clock-out** from the work, he needs to find himself in the list (or grid, depending on the display setting) of all users on the screen. Once he will find himself, click on the <span class="text-red-200">red icon {% include icon.html name="power_settings_new" %}</span>.

- if in the account settings is enabled the setting for force taking the photo of the user during clock-in/out process, the fullscreen window will be displayed. During this time, the user needs to point himself in the front of the camera. The setup of the application can use front or back camera, depending on the setting. The camera will take a photo of the user and the last screen for this process will be displayed.

- after success verification, the process of contacting the server will send clock-in/out of the user.
