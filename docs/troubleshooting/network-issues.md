## "No internet connection!" warning
Once the connection is disconnected, <span class="text-red-200"> **the red blinking circle color indicator** is displayed.</span> Try to {% include icon.html name="network_wifi" %} turn ON the Wi-Fi (or turn OFF and then ON), or check if you have running {% include icon.html name="network_cell" %} Mobile network, or if you have a enough {% include icon.html name="signal_cellular_null" %} signal strength.

## Unable to connect to the network
If you aren't able to connect to the network, follow these steps:
- **turn OFF and ON {% include icon.html name="network_wifi" %} the Wi-Fi** - check if it helps
- or if you are using Mobile network, **turn OFF and ON {% include icon.html name="network_cell" %} the Mobile network** - check if it helps
- if not, check if is there {% include icon.html name="priority_high" %} **exclamation mark** right next to the connection icon, if it's {% include icon.html name="network_wifi" %} Wi-Fi or {% include icon.html name="network_cell" %} Cellular data. If yes, try to investigate, why the device isn't able to connect to the network - probably **wrong network credentials, the external device fault** (external devices like modem, router or switch is running but is not able to communicate with the server) or **something else**.
- if that doesn't help, try to **restart the device** and check the network again
- else contact [the support](mailto:support@orderlord.com) with the description of the problem
